This public repo will document various ways of building a single
CentOS 7 virtual machine that will download a variety of online
resources such as YouTube videos, podcasts, websites, and more.

It's still under construction and needs a lot of work before 
it's ready for general public usage in an easy way.

It's intended to run automatically and download the cached files
onto external storage that is backed up for long term storage.
Important files aren't intended to be kept on the local drive
of this virtual machine.

Perhaps it will be migrated to Docker containers at some point.
